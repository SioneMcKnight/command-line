A stormtrooper has defected from the empire and is spreading lies about the Emperor.

Vader needs your help to find them and eliminate them.

To figure out who the traitor is, you need access to a command line.

Once you're ready, clone this repo or *[download this zip file](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery/archive/master.zip).*

Open the Terminal, navigate to the directory *rebel-traitor-hunt*, and start by reading the file 'instructions-from-vader'.

One way you can do this is with the command:

      cat instructions

(`cat` is a command that will print the contents of a file for you to read.)

To get started on how to use the command line, [this will help you out](https://github.com/CodingForTheEmpire/command-line/blob/master/rebel-traitor-hunt/command-line-manual.md)

Don't use a text editor to view any files except this one, command-line-manual.md, and hints.
