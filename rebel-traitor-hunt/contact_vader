  Copy and paste the following command, replace "traitor_TK_ID" with the suspected traitor's TK ID#, and execute it from inside the rebel-traitor-hunt directory to see if you were correct...

  echo "traitor_TK_ID" | $(command -v md5 || command -v md5sum) | grep -qif .5dmtcerroc && echo "$(cat .5dmrewsna)" || echo "$(cat .5dmgnorw)"
