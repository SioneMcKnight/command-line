There has been a disturbance in the force.

Someone aboard this Death Star has infiltrated sensitive imperial documents, and could endanger Emperor Himself.

You are in charge of finding the traitor. When you do, bring him to me...

- Lord Vader

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, navigate into the directory death-star

Luckily, a stormtrooper before you has marked all of the places that the traitor infiltrated with the word SECURITY-BREACH in the file stormtrooper-report-log. There you should find information to lead you in the right direction...

If you get stuck, open one of the hint files. (from the CL, type 'cat hint1', 'cat hint2', etc.)

To check your answer or find out the solution, open the file 'solution' (from the CL, type 'cat solution').

Don't use a text editor to view any files except these instructions.
