There has been a disturbance in the force.

Someone aboard this Death Star has been infiltrating our files and slandering the Emperor Himself.

Most of the slander includes words like BANTHA_POODOO, PRUNE_FACE, CANT_BELIEVE, and MY_GRANDMA.

You are in charge of finding the Rebel, when you do, bring him to me...

- Lord Vader

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, navigate into the directory secret-death-star-info

Luckily, a stormtrooper before you has marked all of the places that the rebel infiltrated with the word SECURITY-BREACH in the file stormtrooper-report-log. There you should find information to lead you in the right direction...

If you get stuck, open one of the hint files (from the CL, type 'cat hint1', 'cat hint2', etc.).

To check your answer or find out the solution, open the file 'solution' (from the CL, type 'cat solution').

To get started on how to use the command line, open command-line-manual.md (from the command line, you can type 'less command-line-manual.md'. Remember to see more of the file, hit 'enter', and to exit, hit 'q').

Don't use a text editor to view any files except these instructions, the command-line-manual, and hints.
