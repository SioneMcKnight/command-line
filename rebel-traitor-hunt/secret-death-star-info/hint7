In order to actually get information about armor that might match our description,
we need to get multiple lines AROUND each match.  We can use the -A, -B, or -C option with grep:

	grep -A 5 "113" armor-info

This will match the TK ID#'s that contain "113" and, for each match, show us the five lines AFTER it.
